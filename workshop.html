                    <h2>Defining Components</h2>
                    <h3 class="special">"Components are self-contained, reusable, and replaceable units"</h3>
                    <p>While thereâ€™s no universally agreed definition for components, they are built on the principles of Component-Based Architecture (CBA), which focus on modularity, reusability, and independence. The purpose is to create more efficient and scalable applications by dividing the interface into smaller, reusable parts.</p>
                    <p><strong>UI front-end component definition:</strong> It is a group of one or more HTML elements, styled and enhanced with various systems or libraries to add functionality and options, making them functional, reusable parts of the user interface (UI) of a website.</p>

                    <h3>Benefits of using components:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Reducing Redundancy and Errors:</strong> Reusing tested components eliminates duplication of effort, accelerates development timelines, and minimizes the chance of introducing errors.</li>
                        <li><strong>Easier Maintenance:</strong> Individual components can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system, making projects more manageable over time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Since components are designed for reuse, they help ensure that web pages or applications maintain a uniform and cohesive appearance across all elements</li>
                        <li><strong>Better Design Planning:</strong> Understanding this approach enables us to plan and design websites more effectively by identifying reusable components early on, ensuring consistency in design and functionality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Predictable Structure and Location:</strong> Components are organized predictably, making it quick and easy to locate and debug their code.</li>

                    <h2>A Closer Look at UI Front-End Components</h2>
                    <h3>What would Non-UI Font-End Component be?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Utility functions or helpers (e.g., date formatting, API handling),
                            state management,
                            data validation or transformations,
                            event emitters or listeners.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Components that handle application logic, functionality, or data management, without direct visual representation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>UI Front-end components are units that consist of multiple elements, which are designed to have their own:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Structural Element (outputs in HTML)</strong>: The arrangement and layout of elements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Visual Setting (outputs in  CSS)</strong>: The styling that determines how the component appears (e.g., color, font, size).</li>
                        <li><strong>Functionality - (outputs in  JavaScript) - </strong>: The behavior of the component (e.g., clicking a button or submitting a form).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Props and Slots</h3>
                    <p>Flexibility: Components can be styled or behave differently based on their context</p>
                    <p><strong>Props</strong> allow data to be passed into components from a parent, enabling the component to be dynamically configured and reusable in various scenarios. They ensure that components can adjust their behavior or appearance based on specific input values.</p>
                    <p><strong>Slots</strong> provide a mechanism for injecting custom content into a component. This makes components more flexible and adaptable by allowing developers to define and use placeholders for content while preserving the overall structure and functionality of the component.</p>

                    <h2>Usage and Types of Components (Part 1)</h2>
                    <p>Components have become essential across multiple domains in 2024, facilitating modularity and reusability. Here's where they are prominently used:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Frontend Development:</strong> Frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular use components to build UIs. These components are self-contained with their own structure, styling, and behavior making it easy to manage and update individual parts of the interface without affecting the entire application.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mobile Development:</strong> React Native and Flutter use component-based architectures to create seamless, cross-platform applications. This allows developers to write a single codebase while maintaining the native look and feel on different operating systems like iOS and Android.</li>
                        <li><strong>Design Systems:</strong> Predefined components in systems like Material UI, Bootstrap or Tailwind UI ensure consistency in design and behavior across projects. These components also speed up development by providing ready-to-use elements that adhere to accessibility and usability standards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Backend Development:</strong> Server-rendered components and microservices follow similar modular principles.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Some more specific fields od Software Development where components are integral:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> Unity and custom engines use components to define game logic and behaviors, ensuring flexibility and modularity.</li>
                        <li><strong>CMS Platforms:</strong> Drupal and WordPress use content blocks as reusable components for dynamic and structured content. (shouldn't be mixed up with SDC components, they are just integrated into Drupal Theme)</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Libraries like D3.js and Chart.js rely on components for modular charts and graphs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cloud and DevOps:</strong> Tools like Kubernetes and Terraform use modular components to define infrastructure and services.</li>
                        <li><strong>Email Development:</strong> Component-based email design ensures consistency in layout and responsiveness.</li>
                        <li><strong>UI/UX Design:</strong> Tools like Figma use component-based design to create reusable elements, enabling consistency across layouts and making it easier to translate designs into code when moving a website into a design tool.</li>

                    <h2>Our Current Use Case - SDC Components in Drupal</h2>
                    <p>In Drupal, <strong>Single Directory Components (SDC)</strong> are used to organize related files for components in a single directory. This method ensures better modularity and maintainability by grouping all necessary files together.</p>
                    <p><strong>What are SDCs?</strong> SDCs consist of all files related to a specific component, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Twig templates</strong>: The HTML structure for the component's display.</li>
                        <li><strong>CSS/SASS</strong>: The styles that define how the component looks.</li>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: The functionality and interactivity of the component.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assets</strong>: Images, icons, or other media files related to the component.</li>
                        <li><strong>YML files</strong>: The configuration files (e.g., `component-name.yml`) that define how the component is registered and rendered in Drupal.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Currently used in 4 functionally distinctive variants</li>
                        <li>2 visually distinctive variants</li>
                        <li>Includes a slot for customized elements</li>

                    <h3>Case of Improvement</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Problem 1: </strong> The component is not <strong>completely self-contained</strong> as there are styles related to Drupal in it.
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Problem 2: </strong>System-Specfic Content(Content Object) is rendered directly in component, and component can't be ready for all (future) outputs.</li>
                        <li>Urgency for improvements - <strong>Low</strong> - While it almost certainly won't hinder functionality or scalability, it affects code cleanliness and gives a poor impression.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Add an additional slot for Drupal-specific content,  CSS that is used for this slot should be in the main CSS file because its for specfic case(s).
